GOBLIT: Hello?
WIZARD TOX: hmm?
[pause]
GOBLIT: I say, hello? Grand Wizard Tox?
[WIZARD TOX turns around]
WIZARD TOX: *sigh* Yes?
.. choose-all::

    .. choice:: My name is Goblit.

        GOBLIT: I'm Goblit.
        WIZARD TOX: Goblet? That's a strange name.

    .. choice:: About the assistant role?
        GOBLIT: I was told you need an assistant?
        WIZARD TOX: A vacancy has become available, yes.

[GOBLIT moves to CENTRE STAGE]
GOBLIT: I've got a level one certificate in wizarding...
GOBLIT: I can do the three basic spells:
GOBLIT: Turning people into frogs...
GOBLIT: ...sawing women in half...
GOBLIT: ...and finding coins in children's ears.
WIZARD TOX: Hmph. Well, fine.
WIZARD TOX: Don't touch anything, don't break anything, don't set anything on fire.
WIZARD TOX: Including yourself.
WIZARD TOX: Because I had to fill out a lot of forms when the last assistant did that.
[WIZARD TOX turns back to desk]

{Speak to WIZARD TOX}
[WIZARD TOX turns around]
WIZARD TOX: Look, I'm very busy - there's a war on, you know?
GOBLIT: There is?
WIZARD TOX: As Grand Master Wizard, I'm basically our only hope.
WIZARD TOX: Spells to prepare, armies to enchant...
[WIZARD TOX turns back to desk]

{Speak to WIZARD TOX}
WIZARD TOX: Fine, fine. You want something to do? Fetch me a cup of tea.

.. allow:: Take KETTLE

    GOBLIT: Ouch! That is HOT.
    GOBLIT: I think I'm scalded for life.

.. deny:: Give MUG to WIZARD TOX

    GOBLIT: He wants a cup of tea, not an empty cup.

.. allow:: Look at HEAP

    [GOBLIT moves to TEA PILE]
    GOBLIT: It's loose tea.
    GOBLIT: Very loose tea.

    .. rename:: HEAP -> LOOSE TEA

        GOBLIT: I need something to put it in.

    GOBLIT: Ok, I've filled the sock with tea.

.. deny:: Use TEA SOCK with LOOSE TEA

    GOBLIT: It's already full of tea.

.. deny:: Use MUG with LOOSE TEA

    GOBLIT: That's not really the kind of cup of tea anyone wants.

.. allow:: Use TEA SOCK with MUG

    .. craft:: TEA SOCK + MUG -> MUG WITH TEA SOCK

    GOBLIT: Just need some water now.

{Use MUG WITH TEA SOCK with KETTLE}
.. craft:: MUG WITH TEA SOCK -> CUP OF TEA
GOBLIT: I'm not sure this was a good idea.

        GOBLIT: My name is Goblit. I make the tea around here.
        PRINCESS AMELIA: Oh, wow!
        PRINCESS AMELIA: I bet you get to see some wonderful magic spells being cast!

PRINCESS AMELIA: I'm a big fan of magic actually.
PRINCESS AMELIA: Sometimes I come here to read the magic books.
PRINCESS AMELIA: But, as a princess, they don't really let me play around with the dark arts!
GOBLIT: You're... you're Princess Amelia!
[PRINCESS AMELIA blushes]
[pause]
[WIZARD TOX turns around]
WIZARD TOX: Stop dawdling, boy, and offer the princess some tea!
[GOBLIT turns to face PRINCESS AMELIA]
GOBLIT: Um... Would you like a cup of tea?
PRINCESS AMELIA: Sure!
[PRINCESS AMELIA moves to DOWN STAGE LEFT]

# FIXME: Should offer some dialogue choices with the people on set at this point

.. allow:: Take Y WAND

    GOBLIT: It's glowing with magical energies. Ready for use!

.. deny:: Give CUP OF TEA to PRINCESS AMELIA

    GOBLIT: Sure... but then what would I give Wizard Tox?

.. deny:: Give CUP OF TEA to WIZARD TOX

    GOBLIT: Sure... but then what would I give Princess Amelia?

{Use Y WAND with CUP OF TEA}

.. gain:: CUP OF TEA
GOBLIT: So that's what that does.

.. deny:: Give CUP OF TEA to WIZARD TOX

    GOBLIT: Surely I should serve royalty first?

{Give CUP OF TEA to PRINCESS AMELIA}

[PRINCESS AMELIA is disgusted]
PRINCESS AMELIA: *gack*
PRINCESS AMELIA: Well, thank you for the thought.
PRINCESS AMELIA: I can't stay, anyway. I just came to drop this back.
[PRINCESS AMELIA gives LITTLE BOOK OF SPELLS]
PRINCESS AMELIA: I guess I'll see you around, Goblit!
[PRINCESS AMELIA moves to ENTRANCE]
[PRINCESS AMELIA turns to face WIZARD TOX]
PRINCESS AMELIA: Goodbye, Wizard Tox!
WIZARD TOX: Goodbye, princess.
[PRINCESS AMELIA leaves]

WIZARD TOX: Tsk. I do not approve of women learning magic.
[WIZARD TOX turns back to desk]

.. choose-any::
    .. choice:: Why not?

        GOBLIT: Why shouldn't women learn magic?
        [WIZARD TOX turns around]
        WIZARD TOX: Their brains are not built for it, you know.
        WIZARD TOX: They'd end up pulling a frog from behind a child's ear.
        WIZARD TOX: Or turning a frog into a person! Can you imagine?

    .. choice:: ...that's a bit sexist!

        GOBLIT: ...that's a bit...
        WIZARD TOX: And what would they even call a female wizard? A wizard-ess? Ha ha ha.

    .. choice:: Why do you let Princess Amelia read magic books?

        GOBLIT: Why do you let Princess Amelia read magic books?
        [WIZARD TOX turns around]
        WIZARD TOX: Can you imagine what an earful I'd get from Queen Joan if I didn't?
        WIZARD TOX: Besides, she won't be able to do real magic without a wand.

[WIZARD TOX turns back to desk]

.. deny:: Speak to WIZARD TOX

    WIZARD TOX: Where's my cup of tea?

{Give CUP OF TEA to WIZARD TOX}
WIZARD TOX: What would I want tea for? I've got lunch with the Chancellor.
WIZARD TOX: Is that the time?
WIZARD TOX: You - stay here.
[WIZARD TOX leaves]
[GOBLIT moves to NEAR PARROT]

GOBLIT: Oh, just doing my best not to catch fire.
RALPH: Huh?
GOBLIT: Doesn't matter.

.. choose-all::
    .. choice:: How are you?

        GOBLIT: How did you interview go?
        RALPH: Oh, great. Necromancer Vox has put me straight to work.
        RALPH: I'm researching a spell to summon the Great Lords of Hell.
        GOBLIT: That sounds... dangerous.
        RALPH: Oh, sure. But Necromancer Vox likes the big showy spells.
        RALPH: That's why he's the richest wizard in the kingdom.
        GOBLIT: Why isn't he helping with the war?
        RALPH: There's a war?
        [pause]

    .. choice:: Princess Amelia

        GOBLIT: Do you know anything about women?
        RALPH: Oh, sure. Women are easy.
        RALPH: First, you have to wear some snazzy sunglasses.
        RALPH: Second, you have to act cool.
        RALPH: Third, you have to give them a gift, like perfume or something.
        [pause]
        GOBLIT: You don't know anything about women, do you?
        RALPH: ...no.

QUEEN JOAN: Whatever. Listen, I'm afraid Wizard Tox has been eaten.

        QUEEN JOAN: Usual kind of war.

    .. choice:: Why are we at war?

        GOBLIT: What are we warring over, your majesty?
        QUEEN JOAN: Oh, just our very existence.
        QUEEN JOAN: We want to exerminate every last one of them.
        QUEEN JOAN: They want to exerminate every last one of us.
        QUEEN JOAN: Usual kind of war.

    .. choice:: How's it going?

        GOBLIT: Are we winning, your majesty?
        QUEEN JOAN: How do you think it's going? Wizard Tox was just eaten by a dragon.
        QUEEN JOAN: While at lunch with the chancellor.
        QUEEN JOAN: In THIS CASTLE!

[pause]

    .. choice:: My level of expertise

        GOBLIT: I'm not sure I'm qualified...
        QUEEN JOAN: Nonsense. You've got a wizarding certificate, level one, right?
        GOBLIT: Yes...?

QUEEN JOAN: Get to it.
QUEEN JOAN: I want this war over. Cast a spell or something.
QUEEN JOAN: Turn them all into frogs, perhaps.
QUEEN JOAN: Don't you dare leave here until you've got a spell ready.
[QUEEN JOAN leaves]

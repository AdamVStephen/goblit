Scene 1
-------

[GOBLIT enters]
GOBLIT: Hello?
WIZARD TOX: hmm?
[pause]
GOBLIT: I say, hello? Grand Wizard Tox?
[WIZARD TOX turns around]
WIZARD TOX: *sigh* Yes?
.. choose-all::

    .. choice:: My name is Goblit.

        GOBLIT: I'm Goblit.
        WIZARD TOX: Goblet? That's a strange name.

    .. choice:: About the assistant role?
        GOBLIT: I was told you need an assistant?
        WIZARD TOX: A vacancy has become available, yes.

[GOBLIT moves to CENTRE STAGE]
GOBLIT: I've got a level one certificate in wizarding...
GOBLIT: I can do the three basic spells:
GOBLIT: Turning people into frogs...
GOBLIT: ...sawing women in half...
GOBLIT: ...and finding coins in children's ears.
WIZARD TOX: Hmph. Well, fine.
WIZARD TOX: Don't touch anything, don't break anything, don't set anything on fire.
WIZARD TOX: Including yourself.
WIZARD TOX: Because I had to fill out a lot of forms when the last assistant did that.
[WIZARD TOX turns back to desk]

{Speak to WIZARD TOX}
[WIZARD TOX turns around]
WIZARD TOX: Look, I'm very busy - there's a war on, you know?
GOBLIT: There is?
WIZARD TOX: As Grand Master Wizard, I'm basically our only hope.
WIZARD TOX: Spells to prepare, armies to enchant...
[WIZARD TOX turns back to desk]

{Speak to WIZARD TOX}
WIZARD TOX: Fine, fine. You want something to do? Fetch me a cup of tea.

.. deny:: Give MUG to WIZARD TOX

    GOBLIT: He wants a cup of tea, not an empty cup.

.. allow:: Look at HEAP

    [GOBLIT moves to TEA PILE]
    GOBLIT: It's loose tea.

        GOBLIT: I need something to put it in.

    GOBLIT: Ok, I've filled the sock with tea.
    .. gain:: TEA SOCK

.. deny:: Use TEA SOCK with LOOSE TEA

    GOBLIT: It's already full of tea.

.. deny:: Use MUG with LOOSE TEA

    GOBLIT: That's not really the kind of cup of tea anyone wants.

.. allow:: Use TEA SOCK with MUG

    .. lose:: TEA SOCK
    .. lose:: MUG
    .. gain:: MUG WITH TEA SOCK

    GOBLIT: Just need some water now.

{Use MUG WITH TEA SOCK with KETTLE}

.. gain:: CUP OF TEA
GOBLIT: I'm not sure this was a good idea.

[PRINCESS AMELIA enters]
PRINCESS AMELIA: Hello, Wizard Tox!
PRINCESS AMELIA: ...
PRINCESS AMELIA: Hello? Who are you?

.. choose-one::

    .. choice:: Just Goblit.

        GOBLIT: I'm Goblit... I...
        PRINCESS AMELIA: I guess you're the new assistant?
        GOBLIT: New assistant... yes, yes! I just started.
        PRINCESS AMELIA: Oh, cool! What an amazing job!

    .. choice:: I'm Apprentice Wizard Goblit!

        GOBLIT: I'm Goblit, the new apprentice wizard here!
        PRINCESS AMELIA: Oh, wow!

    .. choice:: So far, I just make tea.

        GOBLIT: My name is Goblit. I make the tea around here.
        PRINCESS AMELIA: Oh, wow!
        PRINCESS AMELIA: I bet you get to see some wonderful magic spells being cast!

PRINCESS AMELIA: I'm a big fan of magic actually.
PRINCESS AMELIA: Sometimes I come here to read the magic books.
PRINCESS AMELIA: But, as a princess, they don't really let me play around with the dark arts!
GOBLIT: You're... you're Princess Amelia!
PRINCESS AMELIA: *blush*
WIZARD TOX: Stop dawdling, boy, and offer the princess some tea!
GOBLIT: Um... Would you like a cup of tea?
PRINCESS AMELIA: Sure!

.. allow:: Take Y WAND

    GOBLIT: It's glowing with magical energies. Ready for use!

.. deny:: Give CUP OF TEA to PRINCESS AMELIA

    GOBLIT: Sure... but then what would I give Wizard Tox?

.. deny:: Give CUP OF TEA to WIZARD TOX

    GOBLIT: Sure... but then what would I give Princess Amelia?

{Use Y WAND with CUP OF TEA}

.. gain:: CUP OF TEA
GOBLIT: So that's what that does.

.. deny:: Give CUP OF TEA to WIZARD TOX

    GOBLIT: Surely I should serve royalty first?

{Give CUP OF TEA TEA to PRINCESS AMELIA}

PRINCESS AMELIA: *gack*
PRINCESS AMELIA: Well, thank you for the thought anyway.
PRINCESS AMELIA: I can't stay, anyway. I just came to drop this back.
[PRINCESS AMELIA gives SPELLBOOK]
PRINCESS AMELIA: I guess I'll see you around, Goblit!
PRINCESS AMELIA: Goodbye, Wizard Tox!
WIZARD TOX: Goodbye, princess.
[PRINCESS AMELIA leaves]

WIZARD TOX: Tsk. I do not approve of women learning magic.

.. choice:: Why not?

    GOBLIT: Why shouldn't women learn magic?
    WIZARD TOX: Their brains are not built for it, you know.
    WIZARD TOX: They'd end up pulling a frog from behind a child's ear.
    WIZARD TOX: Or turning a frog into a person! Can you imagine?

.. choice:: ...that's a bit sexist!

    GOBLIT: ...that's a bit...
    WIZARD TOX: And what would they even call a female wizard? A wizard-ess? Ha ha ha.

.. choice:: Why do you let Princess Amelia read magic books?

    GOBLIT: Why do you let Princess Amelia read magic books?
    WIZARD TOX: Can you imagine what an earful I'd get from Queen Joan if I didn't?
    WIZARD TOX: Besides, she won't be able to do real magic without a wand.

{Give CUP OF TEA to WIZARD TOX}
WIZARD TOX: What would I want tea for? I've got lunch with the Chancellor.
WIZARD TOX: Is that the time?
WIZARD TOX: You - stay here.
[WIZARD TOX leaves]

[WIZARD TOX enters]
WIZARD TOX: And don't touch anything, catch fire, etc, etc.
[WIZARD TOX leaves]

GOBLIT: Oh, just doing my best not to catch fire.
RALPH: Huh?
GOBLIT: Doesn't matter.

.. choice:: How are you?

    GOBLIT: How did you interview go?
    RALPH: Oh, great. Necromancer Vox has put me straight to work.
    RALPH: I'm researching a spell to summon the Great Lords of Hell.
    GOBLIT: That sounds... dangerous.
    RALPH: Oh, sure. But Necromancer Vox likes the big showy spells.
    RALPH: That's why he's the richest wizard in the kingdom.
    GOBLIT: Why isn't he helping with the war?
    RALPH: There's a war?

GOBLIT: ...yes? Yes. Of course.

.. choice:: Who with?

    GOBLIT: With whom are we warring, your majesty?
    QUEEN JOAN: Oh, just some ancient, evil sorceror with hordes of minions.
    QUEEN JOAN: Voltak the Evil and the seven legions of Hell.
    QUEEN JOAN: Usual kind of war.

.. choice:: Why?

    GOBLIT: What are we warring over, your majesty?
    QUEEN JOAN: Oh, just our very existence.
    QUEEN JOAN: We want to exerminate every last one of them.

    QUEEN JOAN: Usual kind of war.

.. choice:: How's it going?

    GOBLIT: Are we winning, your majesty?
    QUEEN JOAN: How do you think it's going? Wizard Tox was just eaten by a dragon.
    QUEEN JOAN: While at lunch with the chancellor.
    QUEEN JOAN: In THIS CASTLE!

QUEEN JOAN: So... you're now Grand Wizard.
GOBLIT: I...
QUEEN JOAN: Get to it.
QUEEN JOAN: I want this war over. Cast a spell or something.
QUEEN JOAN: Turn them all into frogs, perhaps.

QUEEN JOAN: It was a disaster! Our men couldn't see EACH OTHER!
QUEEN JOAN: Swords and spears all over the place! It's a miracle nobody lost an eye!
QUEEN JOAN: Meanwhile, the clever ones took the opportunity and left!
QUEEN JOAN: It took me ages to press-gang all those men!

RALPH: You don't want to come play Magician Tennis?
GOBLIT: What's Magician Tennis?
RALPH: Like normal tennis, but with magicians.

[GOBLIT moves to CENTRE STAGE LEFT]
GOBLIT: I didn't know I had a mailbox.

RALPH: So, I hear you're now Grand Wizard!
RALPH: This is priceless.
RALPH: You're the worst wizard in the kingdom.
RALPH: You only just passed the basic certification!

.. choose-all::
    .. choice:: I turned someone into a frog!

        GOBLIT: I turned a man into a frog!
        RALPH: No, you turned him into a frenchman.
        GOBLIT: ...and?

    .. choice:: I sawed a women in half!

        GOBLIT: I sawed a woman in half!
        RALPH: Sure. But you put her legs back on the wrong way round afterwards.

    .. choice:: I pulled a coin from a child's ear!

        GOBLIT: I pulled a coin from a child's ear!
        RALPH: And then you tried to put it back in.

RALPH: Anyway, I remembered you were talking about a girl.
GOBLIT: Ah... Princess Amelia...
[GOBLIT blushes]
RALPH: PRINCESS AMELIA?!
GOBLIT: What? No.
RALPH: Anyway, whoever she is, I bet she likes flowers.
RALPH: And I'm your mate, so I'm sorting you out.
RALPH: I picked this in the castle gardens.
[RALPH gives WILTED FLOWER]
GOBLIT: It's a bit wilted.
RALPH: It's been in my pocket.
RALPH: Find it some water. It'll be fine.

{Read LETTER}
[GOBLIT moves to DOWN STAGE CENTRE]

        RALPH: And I'm Voltak the Evil.

    .. choice:: Some other wizard.

        GOBLIT: A... Distinguished Collegue.
        RALPH: Why does he love you?
        GOBLIT: Accident with a love potion.
        RALPH: Yeah, that makes sense.

GOBLIT: I'd better dig out that spellbook.
RALPH: You don't want to come play Magician Tennis?
GOBLIT: What's Magician Tennis?
RALPH: Like normal tennis, but with magicians.
[pause]
GOBLIT: No, I'm good, thanks.
GOBLIT: Anyway, I don't have time to play tennis; there's a war on.
RALPH: Meh. Your loss. Smell ya later.
[RALPH leaves]
GOBLIT: I wonder what spell she meant?

Scene 1
-------

[GOBLIT enters]
GOBLIT: Hello?
WIZARD TOX: hmm.
GOBLIT: I say, hello? Grand Wizard Tox?
WIZARD TOX: *sigh* Yes?
GOBLIT: I was told you need an assistant?
GOBLIT: I've got a level one certificate in wizarding...
GOBLIT: I can do the three basic spells:
GOBLIT: Turning people into frogs...
GOBLIT: ...sawing women in half...
GOBLIT: ...and finding coins behind children's ears.
WIZARD TOX: Hmph. Well, fine.
WIZARD TOX: Don't touch anything, don't break anything, don't set anything on fire.
WIZARD TOX: Including yourself.
WIZARD TOX: Because I had to fill out a lot of forms when the last assistant did that.

{SPEAK to WIZARD TOX}
WIZARD TOX: Look, I'm very busy - there's a war on, you know?
GOBLIT: There is?
WIZARD TOX: As Grand Master Wizard, I'm basically our only hope.
WIZARD TOX: Spells to prepare, armies to enchant...

{SPEAK to WIZARD TOX}
WIZARD TOX: Fine, fine. You want something to do? Fetch me a cup of tea.

{Take SOCK}
{Use SOCK with TEA CADDY}
{Use TEA SOCK with CUP}

[PRINCESS enters]
PRINCESS: Hello, Wizard Tox!
PRINCESS: ...
PRINCESS: Hello? Who are you?

.. choice:: Just Goblit.

    GOBLIT: I'm Goblit... I...
    PRINCESS: I guess you're the new assistant?
    GOBLIT: New assistant... yes, yes! I just started.
    PRINCESS: Oh, cool! What an amazing job!

.. choice:: I'm Apprentice Wizard Goblit!

    GOBLIT: I'm Goblit, the new apprentice wizard here!
    PRINCESS: Oh, wow!

.. choice:: So far, I just make tea.

    GOBLIT: My name is Goblit. I make the tea around here.
    PRINCESS: Oh, wow!
    PRINCESS: I bet you get to see some wonderful magic spells being cast!

PRINCESS: I'm a big fan of magic actually.
PRINCESS: Sometimes I come here to read the magic books.
PRINCESS: But, as a princess, they don't really let me play around with the dark arts!
GOBLIT: You're... you're Princess Amelia!
PRINCESS: *blush*
WIZARD TOX: Stop dawdling, boy, and offer the princess some tea!
GOBLIT: Um... Would you like a cup of tea?
PRINCESS: Sure!

{Take Y WAND}
{Use WAND with TEA}
{Give TEA to PRINCESS}

PRINCESS: *gack*
PRINCESS: Well, thank you for the thought anyway.
PRINCESS: I can't stay, anyway. I just came to drop this back.
[PRINCESS gives SPELLBOOK]
PRINCESS: I guess I'll see you around, Goblit!
PRINCESS: Goodbye, Wizard Tox!
WIZARD TOX: Goodbye, princess.
[PRINCESS leaves]

WIZARD TOX: Tsk. I do not approve of women learning magic.

.. choice:: Why not?

    GOBLIT: Why shouldn't women learn magic?
    WIZARD TOX: Their brains are not built for it, you know.
    WIZARD TOX: They'd end up pulling a frog from behind a child's ear.
    WIZARD TOX: Or turning a frog into a person! Can you imagine?

.. choice:: ...that's a bit sexist!

    GOBLIT: ...that's a bit...
    WIZARD TOX: And what would they even call a female wizard? A wizard-ess? Ha ha ha.

.. choice:: Why do you let Princess Amelia read magic books?

    GOBLIT: Why do you let Princess Amelia read magic books?
    WIZARD TOX: Can you imagine what an earful I'd get from Queen Joan if I didn't?
    WIZARD TOX: Besides, she won't be able to do real magic without a wand.

{Give TEA to WIZARD TOX}
WIZARD TOX: What would I want tea for? I've got lunch with the Chancellor.
WIZARD TOX: Is that the time?
WIZARD TOX: You - stay here.
[WIZARD TOX leaves]

[WIZARD TOX enters]
WIZARD TOX: And don't touch anything, catch fire, etc, etc.
[WIZARD TOX leaves]

RALPH: Huh?
GOBLIT: Doesn't matter.

    QUEEN: In THIS CASTLE!

QUEEN: So... you're now Grand Wizard.
GOBLIT: I...
QUEEN: Get to it.

    MEPHISTOPHELES: Beat it, loser! You want this war stopped or not?
    GOBLIT: I guess we have no choice.


MEPHISTOPHELES: Ok, I guess we have a deal.
MEPHISTOPHELES: *click* War is over. Grudges forgotten.

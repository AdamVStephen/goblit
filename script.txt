[GOBLIT enters]
GOBLIT: Hello?
WIZARD TOX: hmm?
[pause]
GOBLIT: I say, hello? Grand Wizard Tox?
[WIZARD TOX turns around]
WIZARD TOX: *sigh* Yes?
GOBLIT: I was told you need an assistant?
[GOBLIT moves to CENTRE STAGE]
GOBLIT: I've got a level one certificate in wizarding...
GOBLIT: I can do the three basic spells:
GOBLIT: Turning people into frogs...
GOBLIT: ...sawing women in half...
GOBLIT: ...and finding coins in children's ears.
WIZARD TOX: Hmph. Well, fine.
WIZARD TOX: Don't touch anything, don't break anything, don't set anything on fire.
WIZARD TOX: Including yourself.
WIZARD TOX: Because I had to fill out a lot of forms when the last assistant did that.
[WIZARD TOX turns back to desk]

{Speak to WIZARD TOX}
[GOBLIT moves to CENTRE STAGE RIGHT]
[WIZARD TOX turns around]
WIZARD TOX: Look, I'm very busy - there's a war on, you know?
GOBLIT: There is?
WIZARD TOX: As Grand Master Wizard, I'm basically our only hope.
WIZARD TOX: Spells to prepare, armies to enchant...
[WIZARD TOX turns back to desk]

    PRINCESS: I guess you're the new assistant?
    GOBLIT: New assistant... yes, yes! I just started.
    PRINCESS: Oh, cool! What an amazing job!

.. choice:: I'm Apprentice Wizard Goblit!

    GOBLIT: I'm Goblit, the new apprentice wizard here!
    PRINCESS: Oh, wow!

.. choice:: So far, I just make tea.

    GOBLIT: My name is Goblit. I make the tea around here.
    PRINCESS: Oh, wow!
    PRINCESS: I bet you get to see some wonderful magic spells being cast!

PRINCESS: I'm a big fan of magic actually.
PRINCESS: Sometimes I come here to read the magic books.
PRINCESS: But, as a princess, they don't really let me play around with the dark arts!
GOBLIT: You're... you're Princess Amelia!

PRINCESS: Sure!

PRINCESS: Goodbye, Wizard Tox!
WIZARD TOX: Goodbye, princess.
[PRINCESS leaves]

WIZARD TOX: Tsk. I do not approve of women learning magic.

.. choice:: Why not?

    GOBLIT: Why shouldn't women learn magic?
    WIZARD TOX: Their brains are not built for it, you know.
    WIZARD TOX: They'd end up pulling a frog from behind a child's ear.
    WIZARD TOX: Or turning a frog into a person! Can you imagine?

.. choice:: ...that's a bit sexist!

    GOBLIT: ...that's a bit...
    WIZARD TOX: And what would they even call a female wizard? A wizard-ess? Ha ha ha.

.. choice:: Why do you let Princess Amelia read magic books?

    GOBLIT: Why do you let Princess Amelia read magic books?
    WIZARD TOX: Can you imagine what an earful I'd get from Queen Joan if I didn't?
    WIZARD TOX: Besides, she won't be able to do real magic without a wand.

{Give TEA to WIZARD TOX}
WIZARD TOX: What would I want tea for? I've got lunch with the Chancellor.
WIZARD TOX: Is that the time?
WIZARD TOX: You - stay here.
[WIZARD TOX leaves]

[WIZARD TOX enters]

RALPH: Huh?
GOBLIT: Doesn't matter.

.. choice:: How are you?

    GOBLIT: How did you interview go?
    RALPH: Oh, great. Necromancer Vox has put me straight to work.
    RALPH: I'm researching a spell to summon the Great Lords of Hell.
    GOBLIT: That sounds... dangerous.

    GOBLIT: Why isn't he helping with the war?
    RALPH: There's a war?

QUEEN: So... you're now Grand Wizard.
